# Hi, I'm Ankit

I am a technology enthusiast with a solid foundation in computer science and practical experience in software engineering, web development, and system architecture. Over the course of my academic and project-based work, I’ve developed and deployed real-world applications using modern technologies and frameworks, focusing on both frontend and backend development.

My strengths lie in writing clean, maintainable code, understanding system-level interactions, and building scalable solutions tailored to user needs. I bring a collaborative mindset, strong attention to detail, and a problem-solving approach to every technical challenge I face.

I am particularly passionate about exploring the intersection of full-stack development and intelligent systems, and continuously expanding my knowledge in areas such as AI, cybersecurity, and cloud-native applications. Currently, I am seeking project-based roles or internships where I can contribute meaningfully, work with modern tools and teams, and continue to grow as a developer.
