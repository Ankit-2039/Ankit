# Ankit Kumar

I am a dedicated and solution-oriented computer applications graduate with a strong passion for technology, full-stack web development, and intelligent systems. I specialize in building scalable, real-time applications using the MERN stack and integrating AI/ML capabilities where applicable. My work reflects a strong balance between clean code, performance optimization, and user-centric design.
